# OrderManagment
Desktop app to management an offers and clients in small company. It have a few simple functions like add clients, remove clients, add offers.

While I was working as a design engineer in small company in Krakow, I didn`t have my own order management system at work, so I decided to do it by my own app.
I've learned java after my work and write some code.
Finally, now it works, but i have a few idea to develop it.
For example, I learn SQL do make a database to connect with app.
